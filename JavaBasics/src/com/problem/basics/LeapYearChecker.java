/*Coding Exercise: Is Leap Year
You are given a class LeapYearChecker with a method isLeapYear(int year). Your task is to complete the implementation of the method to determine if a given year is a leap year.
The rules are a little tricky. Read them carefully.
A year is a leap year in the Gregorian calendar if:

It is divisible by 4 (AND)
It is NOT divisible by 100 (except when it is divisible by 400)
Not Divisible by 4 - NOT Leap Year (2041)
Divisble by 4 and NOT divisible by 100 - Leap Year (2048)
Divisible by 4 and divisible by 100 - Additional check needed
Divisible by 4, divisible by 100, divisible by 400 - Leap Year (2000, 2400)
Divisible by 4, divisible by 100, NOT divisible by 400 - NOT Leap Year (2100, 2200, 2300)

Instructions
Implement the isLeapYear method to return true if the year is a leap year and false otherwise.
You need to account for the edge case where the year is less than 1. For such a case, the method should return false.
